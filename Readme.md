## 🧩 Game Overview

The game loop is implemented in `main.py` and drives the overall execution of the game. The game is organized into three main scenes where each
scene is responsible for its own drawing, updating, and event handling:

- **`MenuScene`** – Displays the main menu with levels.  
- **`LevelScene`** – Core gameplay scene that loads level data, creates entities, and handles level progression.  
- **`PauseScene`** – Activated during gameplay to display the pause menu and allow the player to resume or quit.

All game characters inherit from a common base class, `Entity`, which defines shared behavior such as movement, collision, and interaction. 
Entities have assigned weapons, allowing them to shoot using customizable logic. The game includes various enemy types, such as the standard base enemy, 
**Shrinker** (a smaller, agile enemy), **Invisible** (hard to detect), and **Triple** (equipped with a weapon that fires three bullets simultaneously).

## 🧱 Design Principles

The codebase is designed with **high cohesion** and **loose coupling** in mind. Each module has a clear responsibility, which makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and extend. This modular approach ensures that new features or changes can be introduced with minimal impact on the existing code.

## 🧪 Testing

The game was manually tested by playing through all levels on various screen resolutions
and setups to ensure smooth gameplay and UI scaling. 

### Tested On:
- WQXGA (2560x1600)
- Full HD (1920x1080)
